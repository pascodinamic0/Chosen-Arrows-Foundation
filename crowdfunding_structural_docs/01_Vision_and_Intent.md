# Project Vision & Intent

## Purpose
This platform is not a crowdfunding website.
It is a decision engine that converts emotional clarity into human action.

## Core Truth
If a visitor leaves without acting, a child sleeps hungry.
The website must make this consequence emotionally clear without manipulation.

## Non‑Negotiable Principles
- Emotion before information
- One human story before any organization story
- Agency over guilt
- Relief over hope

## Target Outcome
Visitors should feel:
- Clear about what is happening
- Personally responsible for what happens next
- Confident their action creates real change

## Success Definition
Success is not traffic or donations.
Success is when the visitor feels they *chose* an outcome.
