# Narrative Architecture — 5 Scene System

## SCENE 1: MOMENT
A present‑tense human freeze‑frame.
One child. One night. One unresolved outcome.

Rules:
- No mission statements
- No CTAs
- No statistics

## SCENE 2: CAUSE
Explain why this moment exists.
Systemic clarity, not emotional language.

Rules:
- No adjectives like tragic or heartbreaking
- No organizational promotion

## SCENE 3: MIRROR
Collapse distance between visitor and child.
Parallel daily lives.

Rules:
- Calm tone
- No pity language

## SCENE 4: CHOICE
Turn money into responsibility.
Donation = decision.

Rules:
- No “Donate” wording
- Each option explains what changes

## SCENE 5: RELIEF
Preview the future if this works.

Rules:
- Show scenes, not promises
- Sell relief, not hope
